## 一、倒装句

中文：我有事走先

为什么用倒装句：表示强调、 句法结构需要

```java
impossible is nothing. // 没有不可能
```

### 1.1 全部倒装

将句子的谓语全部置于主语之前

```java
// 老板进来了
The boss 'came in'. 
'In came' the boss. 
```

类型

```java
// 1、there be句型
There is a cat. = A cat is there. // 那有一只猫
There is a door. = The door is there. // 那有一道门
There are two computer. = Two computer are there. // 那有两台电脑
There was nobody. = Nobody was there. // 那里没有人

// 2、句首有时间 地点 副词 或 介词短语
There is a temple on the mountain, There is a monk in the temple. 
=  On the mountain is a temple, In the temple lives a monk.  //山上有个庙，庙里有个和尚
There is a cat behind the door.  =  Behind the door is a cat. // 门后是只猫

// 3、so、nor、either
So do I // 我也是
So does he. // 他也是
Nor do I. // 我也不
Either did I.  // 我以前也不
```



### 1.2 部分倒装

将句子的谓语一部分（助动词、情态动词、be动词）置于主语之前，如果句子的谓语没有助动词或者情态动词，需要添加助动词do、does、did再把它放到主语前面

```java
// 我以前从未见过这么快的车
I 'have' never seen a car so fast before. 
Never before 'have' I seen a car so fast. 
```

```java
// 1、only修饰的状语在句首
Only in this way can you have plenty of chances to make new friends. // 只有这样了才能有机会交新朋友
Only then did I begin to like her. // 直到那个时候我才开始喜欢他

// 2、某些否定意义的词在句首，例如：never，hardly，little，not，nowhere等
Never before have I seen her. // 我从来没有见过他
Nowhere can you find a good quality school. // 在那里都找不到这样高质量的学校

// 3、只是前半部分倒装， 句首是Not only ... But also,  Not only...But...as well; No sooner...that; hardly...when
Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. // 这个可怜的人不仅被捕，而且还被送入监狱
No sooner had he said that we would do the job. // 不久他就会说我们会做这份工作

// 4、as引导的让步状语从句，谓语动词以后倒装
Though it is sunny day, I shall not go out
The sunny day as it is, I shall not go out. // 今天虽然晴天，但我出不去
Though he worked hard, He is still penniless. 
Hard as he worked, He is still penniless.  // 尽管他努力工作，但他仍然贫困潦倒

// 5、省略if的虚拟条件语句，were，had，should等在主语前放在句首
If I were you, I must try it.
Were I you, I must try it. // 如果我是你，我必须尝试一下
If you had any questions, I can help you
Had you any questions, I can help you. // 如果有任何疑问，我可以提供帮助

// 6、so加形容词或者副词在句首
So quickly does light travel that we can hardly imagine its speed. // 光速如此快我们几乎无法想象它的速度
So sudden was the attack that we had no time to escape. // 袭击非常突然我们没有时间逃跑

// 7、表达祝愿的一些句子
May you succeed. // 祝你成功
```

## 二、强调句

强调说明句子里的某个部分，表达情感意愿

```java
It was he that helped me yesterday. // 昨天是他帮了我	
```

强调句句型: It + is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who/whom/which + 其余部分

```java
Peter lost his cell phone in the mall yesterday.  // 昨天皮特在商场把手机丢了
It was 'Peter' that lost cell phone in the mall yesterday. 
It was 'his cell phone' that Peter lost in the mall yesterday. 
It was 'int the mall' that Peter lost his call phone yesterday.
It was 'yesterday' that Peter lost his cell phone in the mall. 
```

```java
// 一般疑问句：is/was it + 被强调部分 + that/who/whom + 其余部分?
Was it 'Peter' who lost cell phone in the mall yesterday?  // 昨天在商场丢手机的是皮特吗

// 特殊疑问句: 疑问词 + is/was it + that/who/whom + 其余部分？
'Where' was it that  'Peter lost his cell phone yesterday'? //皮特昨天在哪里丢了他的手机？
  
// 助动词do/does/did强调谓语动词
I 'do' agree with you. // 我同意你
I 'did' work hard this year.  // 今年我确实很努力
  
// 强调句和主语从句的区别，去掉it be that看句子是否完整
强调句： 'It was' Pater 'that' lost cell phone in the mall yesterday. 
主语从句： 'It is' certain 'that' he weil win the match. // 他肯定会赢得这场比赛
  
// 强调句和定语从句的区别， 看引导词，强调句翻译不出'的'字
强调句： It was in the mall 'that' he lost his cell phone.
定语从句：  It was in the mall 'where' he lost his cell phone. 
  
// 强调句和状语从句的区别，看引导词，状语从句是两句话
强调句： It was in the morning 'that' he woke up. 
状语从句： It was in the morning 'when' he woke up.
```

## 三、虚拟语气

真实条件：可能发生的用主将从现

虚拟条件：不可能发生的假设用虚拟语气

```java
If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home. // 如果明天下雨，我会待在家里
If it should rain every day, I could be mad. // 如果每天都下雨，我可能会疯掉
```

```
// 从句对现在虚拟
If I were you, I would marry him without any hesitation. // 如果我是你，我会毫不犹豫的嫁给他
// 从句对过去虚拟

// 从句对将来虚拟

```



## 四、插入语

## 五、双否
