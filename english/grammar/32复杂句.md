## 一、倒装句

中文：我有事走先

为什么用倒装句：表示强调、 句法结构需要

```java
impossible is nothing. // 没有不可能
```

### 1.1 全部倒装

将句子的谓语全部置于主语之前

```java
// 老板进来了
The boss 'came in'. 
'In came' the boss. 
```

类型

```java
// 1、there be句型
There is a cat. = A cat is there. // 那有一只猫
There is a door. = The door is there. // 那有一道门
There are two computer. = Two computer are there. // 那有两台电脑
There was nobody. = Nobody was there. // 那里没有人

// 2、句首有时间 地点 副词 或 介词短语
There is a temple on the mountain, There is a monk in the temple. 
=  On the mountain is a temple, In the temple lives a monk.  //山上有个庙，庙里有个和尚
There is a cat behind the door.  =  Behind the door is a cat. // 门后是只猫

// 3、so、nor、either
So do I // 我也是
So does he. // 他也是
Nor do I. // 我也不
Either did I.  // 我以前也不
```



### 1.2 部分倒装

将句子的谓语一部分（助动词、情态动词、be动词）置于主语之前，如果句子的谓语没有助动词或者情态动词，需要添加助动词do、does、did再把它放到主语前面

```java
// 我以前从未见过这么快的车
I 'have' never seen a car so fast before. 
Never before 'have' I seen a car so fast. 
```

```java
// 1、only修饰的状语在句首
Only in this way can you have plenty of chances to make new friends. // 只有这样了才能有机会交新朋友
Only then did I begin to like her. // 直到那个时候我才开始喜欢他

// 2、某些否定意义的词在句首，例如：never，hardly，little，not，nowhere等
Never before have I seen her. // 我从来没有见过他
Nowhere can you find a good quality school. // 在那里都找不到这样高质量的学校

// 3、只是前半部分倒装， 句首是Not only ... But also,  Not only...But...as well; No sooner...that; hardly...when
Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. // 这个可怜的人不仅被捕，而且还被送入监狱
No sooner had he said that we would do the job. // 不久他就会说我们会做这份工作

// 4、as引导的让步状语从句，谓语动词以后倒装
Though it is sunny day, I shall not go out
The sunny day as it is, I shall not go out. // 今天虽然晴天，但我出不去
Though he worked hard, He is still penniless. 
Hard as he worked, He is still penniless.  // 尽管他努力工作，但他仍然贫困潦倒

// 5、省略if的虚拟条件语句，were，had，should等在主语前放在句首
If I were you, I must try it.
Were I you, I must try it. // 如果我是你，我必须尝试一下
If you had any questions, I can help you
Had you any questions, I can help you. // 如果有任何疑问，我可以提供帮助

// 6、so加形容词或者副词在句首
So quickly does light travel that we can hardly imagine its speed. // 光速如此快我们几乎无法想象它的速度
So sudden was the attack that we had no time to escape. // 袭击非常突然我们没有时间逃跑

// 7、表达祝愿的一些句子
May you succeed. // 祝你成功
```

## 二、强调句

强调说明句子里的某个部分，表达情感意愿

```java
It was he that helped me yesterday. // 昨天是他帮了我	
```

强调句句型: It + is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who/whom/which + 其余部分

```java
Peter lost his cell phone in the mall yesterday.  // 昨天皮特在商场把手机丢了
It was 'Peter' that lost cell phone in the mall yesterday. 
It was 'his cell phone' that Peter lost in the mall yesterday. 
It was 'int the mall' that Peter lost his call phone yesterday.
It was 'yesterday' that Peter lost his cell phone in the mall. 
```

```java
// 一般疑问句：is/was it + 被强调部分 + that/who/whom + 其余部分?
Was it 'Peter' who lost cell phone in the mall yesterday?  // 昨天在商场丢手机的是皮特吗

// 特殊疑问句: 疑问词 + is/was it + that/who/whom + 其余部分？
'Where' was it that  'Peter lost his cell phone yesterday'? //皮特昨天在哪里丢了他的手机？
  
// 助动词do/does/did强调谓语动词
I 'do' agree with you. // 我同意你
I 'did' work hard this year.  // 今年我确实很努力
  
// 强调句和主语从句的区别，去掉it be that看句子是否完整
强调句： 'It was' Pater 'that' lost cell phone in the mall yesterday. 
主语从句： 'It is' certain 'that' he weil win the match. // 他肯定会赢得这场比赛
  
// 强调句和定语从句的区别， 看引导词，强调句翻译不出'的'字
强调句： It was in the mall 'that' he lost his cell phone.
定语从句：  It was in the mall 'where' he lost his cell phone. 
  
// 强调句和状语从句的区别，看引导词，状语从句是两句话
强调句： It was in the morning 'that' he woke up. 
状语从句： It was in the morning 'when' he woke up.
```

## 三、虚拟语气

虚拟语气是一种语法结构，用于表示假设、愿望、建议等不真实或假设的情况。在英语中，虚拟语气通常通过虚拟条件句和虚拟表达式来表达。

虚拟条件句通常由"if"引导，后面跟着一个动词的过去时（常称为虚拟语气的过去时），表示与过去或现在事实相反的情况。

```java
// 这个句子表示的是一个与现实相反的假设，即我并不富有，所以也无法环游世界。
If I were rich, I would travel around the world.  // 如果我有钱，我就会环游世界。
```

虚拟表达式可以用来表达愿望、建议和建议等情况。例如："I wish I were taller."（我希望我能更高一些。）这个例子中，使用了虚拟语气"were"来表达一个不可能实现的愿望。

真实条件：可能发生的用主将从现

虚拟条件：不可能发生的假设用虚拟语气

```java
If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home. // 如果明天下雨，我会待在家里
If it should rain every day, I could be mad. // 如果每天都下雨，我可能会疯掉
```

![](https://gaoqisen.github.io/GraphBed/202312/20231225231824.png)

```java
// 从句对现在虚拟
If I were you, I would marry him without any hesitation. // 如果我是你，我会毫不犹豫的嫁给他
// 从句对过去虚拟
If you had come yesterday, you would have met he. // 如果你昨天来的话，你就会见到他了
// 从句对将来虚拟
If it should rain. the crops 'would be' saved. // 如果下雨的话，农作物将会获救
```

```java
// 省略if的虚拟语气were，had，should等在主语前放在句首，条件句要部分倒装
If I were you, I must try it. //  如果我是你，我必须尝试一下
Were I you, I must try it. 

If you had any questions, I can help you. // 如有任何疑问，我可以提供帮助
Had you any questions, I can help you. 
```

名词性虚拟语气

```java
// 表示希望愿望含义的词
I wish I were to become a pilot. // 我希望我能成为一名飞行员
  
// 表示命令建议含义的词时，should加动词原形，should可以省略
The doctor advised that she(should) cares about her health. // 医生建议她要关心自己的健康
  
// 表示宁愿怎么样时用虚拟语气，would rather加过去式
You tell them that I would rather died here. // 你告诉他们我宁愿死这里
  
// It be + 形容词 + that什么 + should + 动词原形，should可以省略
It is clear that she(should) try it. // 显然她应该试了
```

状语从句的虚拟语气

```java
// 表示与将来情况不同：if only + 从句主语 + would（could，might） + 动词原形
I told her if only she would try again. // 我告诉她，如果她会在试一次

// 表示与现在情况不同：if only + 从句主语 + 动词过去式
I told her if only I didn't live in London. // 我告诉她，如果我不住在伦敦

// 表达欲过去情况不同： if only + 从句主语 + would/could have/had + 过去分词
I told her if only you had come to my birthday party. // 我告诉她，你要是来我的生日晚会就好了
  
// in case 、for fear that、lest引导的状语从句虚拟语气，should可以省略
We took a lot of guns with 'in case/for fear that/lest' it should meet terrorist. // 为了防备恐怖分子，我们带了很多枪  
```

其他虚拟

对现在的虚拟：would + do

对过去的虚拟：would（not） + have done

```
// Without 
Alex had done this without consulting her. // 亚历克斯这么做事先并没有跟她商量

// but for
But for your help, I might have failed. // 假如没有你帮忙，我兴许会失败

// Otherwise
It was for the police to assess the validity or otherwise of the evidence. // 应该由警方来判定证据有效与否
```

最好用的虚拟语气without...would + 动词原形

```java
Without these our life would disintegrate...  // 如果没有这些我们的生活将崩溃...也不能用了
```

用虚拟语气进行正反论证，提升写作论述能力

```java
// 研究显示天生特质和后天发展对我们性格有巨大影响，你认为主要的影响是什么？
Research indicates that the characteristics we were born with have much more influence on our personality and development than experiences we have had in our life. Which do you think is the major influence?

// 从父母那里继承的特质和我们在生活中遇到的情况和经历是不断相互影响的，正是这两者的相互作用塑造了一个人的性格，并决定了这种性格的发展，如果这不是真的，我们可以在一个人出生时，就预测他的行为和性格
The traits we inherit from our parents and the situation and experiences that we encounter in life are constantly interacting. It is the interaction of the two that shapes a person’s personality and dictates how that personality.
If this were not true, we would be able to predict the behavior and character of a person from the moment they were born.
```

## 四、插入语

前后逗号隔开，插在主句里面，删掉插入语不影响整体句意，可以插入一个词一个短语几个词一个句子

```
// 我认为其他的措施可能同样有效，甚至更多
I think there are other measures which could be equally, 'if not more', effective.
```

作用：进行补充说，让句子更加的精确客观，对句子进行强调，进行过渡转折

```java
Cats, 'it seems', love to chew up cable. // 似乎猫喜欢咬电线

The reason, 'of course', is that costs have rocketed. // 原因当然是成本飞涨

Instead of becoming a doctor, 'howere', he became a successful writer of detective stories. // 然后，他没有成为医生而是成为了成功的侦探小说作家
```

位置：句首、句中、句尾都可以

```
// 句首
'Strange', there is nobody in the classroom. // 奇怪，教室里没人

// 句中
Turkey would, 'of course', be the main dish. // 当然，火鸡将是主菜

// 句尾
I prefer to go tomorrow afternoon, 'at 6 pm'.  // 我打算明天下午去，在下午6点吧
```



## 五、双否

一个句子有两个否定因素，句子就变成肯定了

```java
Impossible is nothing. // 没有什么不可能  
```

常见

```java
// ...not fail to do...
You can not fail to obey it. // 你不可能不遵守它

// ...never fail to do...
The cat never fail to fascinate human beings. // 猫总是让人类着迷

// can not ... too (越...越)
You can not drive too carefully. // 你开车越小心越好

// no shortage of(不缺)
There is no shortage of good ideas here.  // 这里不缺好主意

// not un(unlike/unusual/unable等否定前缀)
My devision thinking is not unlike common. // 我的决思维不像是一般人
```

怎么写

```java
// 大家很高兴
Everybody was happy. 
Nobody was unhappy. 
```

万能双否句型

```java
// No one could deny the fact that…没人能否认
No one could deny the fact that everybody was happy. // 没有人能否认大家都很高兴

// There is no denying that…不可否认
There is no denying that everybody was happy. // 不可否认大家都很高兴
```
